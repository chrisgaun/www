## What is KUDO?

Kubernetes Universal Declarative Operator (KUDO) provides a declarative approach to building production-grade Kubernetes Operators covering the entire application lifecycle.

## When should I use KUDO?

When you need more than just `kubectl apply -f` to run your application.
When you want to provide application lifecycle scripts to application operators, but don’t want to provide scripts/documentation for them to follow.
When you don’t want to write your own operator.
